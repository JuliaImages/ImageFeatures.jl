To achieve this, we will train the classifier on an intermediate representation of the image instead of the pixel-based representation. Our ideal representation (commonly called feature vector) captures information which is useful for classification but is invariant to small changes in illumination and occlusions. HOG descriptor is a gradient-based representation which is invariant to local geometric and photometric changes (i.e. shape and illumination changes) and so is a good choice for our problem. In fact HOG descriptors are widely used for object detection.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/object_detection/","page":"Object Detection using HOG","title":"Object Detection using HOG","text":"Download the script to get the training data here.
